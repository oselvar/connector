# Contributing to Oselvar Connector

Before you contribute, make sure you can build the code and run the tests.

## Prerequisites

You need `node` and `npm` version `7.7.0` or later. If you don't have it, upgrade:

    npm install -g npm@latest

## Install dependencies

    npm install

## Upgrade dependencies

    npm run upgrade && npm run upgrade --workspaces && npm run clean && npm install

## Run tests

    npm test --workspaces

## Transpile the code

You don't really need to run this, but it sometimes finds errors.

    npm run build

## Format the code

This will automatically format the code for you:

    npm run eslint-fix

## Make a change

Please write tests for your code. Contributions without tests will not be accepted.
When you think you're done, send a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Make a release

We typically release all the modules at the same time.

    npm run build
    
    pushd packages/connector-core
    npm version --allow-same-version CONNECTOR_CORE_VERSION
    npm publish --access public
    popd

    # Update package.json with CONNECTOR_CORE_VERSION
    pushd packages/connector-github
    npm version --allow-same-version CONNECTOR_GITHUB_VERSION
    npm publish --access public
    popd

    git push && git push --tags

We'll simplify this with a script later...
